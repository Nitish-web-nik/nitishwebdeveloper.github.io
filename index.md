	    <h1>This is me Nitish</h1>
	    <p1></p1>Hello everyone, Myself Nitish. It's 3:30 P.M,26th of may.I am trying to host my website for two days with fun but now It is going somewhat hard. First of all my sublime text editor didn't worked well, So it took me 2 hours approx to fix it. After this  My cPanel didn't worked. All time on the screen there is an error 404. And traceback in the code of python. To fix it also it took me almost 1 hour.Now I think approx all the bugs get fixed. I started to work on this project. I am very happy that I got my hosting site name and domain but again the code is not properly running in the webpage. It's too hot here, there is no electricity for four hours and I am continuosly fixing my bug in this summer. It's is quite fun to something which leads to the discomfort to you unless you are trying your best.:). Sorry to say but my battery is about to die. I will definitely going to continue this so that I could submit the assignment on coursera and get my first website through both cpanel and github webpage. Bye.

	<p2> Today It's 2:47 A:M of 27th may, I have started it. And now it is 7:00 A.M. I'm very happy to say that My project get's completed with no error. Now, I am going to submit my project. I'm also gonna give you the link to the project which was quite easy but the main purpose was the accessibility and hosting your own website which was the main purpose of this course and how different web servers differently behaves with your website. There was much more patience required to fix your bug even it took you to giving error continuosly. I'm quite happy with this. I have done it. And definitely I'm going to share this with my favorite one's.:)</p2>
