	    <p1></p1>Hello everyone, My name is Nitish. I am trying to host my website for two days with fun but now It is going somewhat hard. My sublime text editor worked well, My cPanel worked well, I got my hosting site name and domain but the code is not properly running in the webpage. It's too hot there is no electric light here for three hours and I am continuosly fixing my bug in this summer. It's is quite fun to something which leads to the discomfort to you unless you are trying your best.:)</p1>
